    <p id="elevatorpitch">Justin Kacher is a Junior at Apex Friendship High school, and has been part  of the Academy of Engineering for the entirety of high school.  He is a very driven student who always wants to learn more. He demonstrates this ability by tinkering with electronics, learning CAD at an intermediate level, and 3D printing in his spare time. There is never a moment when He is not working on a project. Weather it be something as simple as designing and building a circuit to wire LED's into a kayak, or something as complex as building a hovercraft. However he also is very dedicated to his schooling. He is a member of the National Honor society, and has been a part of speech and debate since his freshman year. If that was not enough, he also serves on the Academy of Engineering student board, and is part of Gravity Games, which allows students to apply engineering skills learned through the academy into a real life competition.</p>
